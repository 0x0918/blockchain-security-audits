# Protocol has upgradeable contracts that cannot be upgraded

## Vulnerability details
## Impact
Protocol cannot upgrade the upgradeable contract.

## Proof of Concept
SmartAccount.sol uses ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable but not UUPSUpgradeable.
```
contract SmartAccount is 
     Singleton,
     BaseSmartAccount,
     IERC165,
     ModuleManager,
     SignatureDecoder,
     SecuredTokenTransfer,
     ISignatureValidatorConstants,
     FallbackManager,
     Initializable,
     ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable
    {
```
## Tools Used
Manual Review

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
import UUPSUpgradeable, inherit the contract, and initialize the contract
```
import {UUPSUpgradeable} from "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/UUPSUpgradeable.sol";
contract SmartAccount is 
     Singleton,
     BaseSmartAccount,
     IERC165,
     ModuleManager,
     SignatureDecoder,
     SecuredTokenTransfer,
     ISignatureValidatorConstants,
     FallbackManager,
     Initializable,
     ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable
+    UUPSUpgradeable
    {
    function init(address _owner, address _entryPointAddress, address _handler) public override initializer { 
        require(owner == address(0), "Already initialized");
        require(address(_entryPoint) == address(0), "Already initialized");
        require(_owner != address(0),"Invalid owner");
        require(_entryPointAddress != address(0), "Invalid Entrypoint");
        require(_handler != address(0), "Invalid Entrypoint");
+       __UUPSUpgradeable_init();
        owner = _owner;
        _entryPoint =  IEntryPoint(payable(_entryPointAddress));
        if (_handler != address(0)) internalSetFallbackHandler(_handler);
        setupModules(address(0), bytes(""));
    }
```
Also add storage gap for upgradeable contracts.
```
uint256[45] private __gap;
```
