## Vulnerability details
## Impact
EntryPoint address in SmartAccount.sol cannot execute certain functions because of the onlyOwner modifier.

Proof of Concept
The functions SmartAccount.execute() and SmartAccount.executeBatch() has an onlyOwner modifier.
```
function execute(address dest, uint value, bytes calldata func) external onlyOwner{
function executeBatch(address[] calldata dest, bytes[] calldata func) external onlyOwner{
```
However, both functions call another function _requireFromEntryPointOrOwner();
```
    _requireFromEntryPointOrOwner();
```
which checks if msg.sender is adderss(entryPoint()) or owner
```
function _requireFromEntryPointOrOwner() internal view {
    require(msg.sender == address(entryPoint()) || msg.sender == owner, "account: not Owner or EntryPoint");
}
```
Since execute() and executeBatch() has an onlyOwner modifier which checks if msg.sender is owner only,
```
modifier onlyOwner {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Smart Account:: Sender is not authorized");
    _;
}
```
address(entryPoint()) cannot call the function execute() and executeBatch().

## Tools Used
VSCode

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Either take out the onlyOwner modifer in the two functions or remove the _requireFromEntryPointOrOwner() check if the function intends to not allow the msg.sender to be address(entryPoint()).
