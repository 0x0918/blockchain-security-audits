## Vulnerability details
## Impact
DBR.setReplenishmentPriceBps has no upper bound. A malicious operator can set a basis point above 10000 and markets can force borrowers in deficit to incur a huge debt.

## Proof of Concept
replenishmentPriceBps is used in onForceReplenish, and only the market can call onForceReplenish to increase the debt of the borrower and mint them new DBR
```
    function onForceReplenish(address user, uint amount) public {
        require(markets[msg.sender], "Only markets can call onForceReplenish");
        uint deficit = deficitOf(user);
        require(deficit > 0, "No deficit");
        require(deficit >= amount, "Amount > deficit");
        uint replenishmentCost = amount * replenishmentPriceBps / 10000;
        accrueDueTokens(user);
        debts[user] += replenishmentCost;
        _mint(user, amount);
    }
```
If replenishmentPriceBps is 10,000, 1 DBR will be minted and 1 DOLA will be added to the borrower's debt.
If replenishmentPriceBps is 1,000,000, 1 DBR will be minted and 100 DOLA will be added to the borrower's debt, which makes it unfair for the borrower.

## Tools Used
Manual Review

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Set a limit for setReplenishmentPriceBps
```
    function setReplenishmentPriceBps(uint newReplenishmentPriceBps_) public onlyOperator {
        @--audit no upperbound
        require(newReplenishmentPriceBps_ > 0, "replenishment price must be over 0");
        replenishmentPriceBps = newReplenishmentPriceBps_;
    }
```
similar to setColateralFactorBps and setLiquidationFactorBps in Market.sol
```
    function setReplenishmentPriceBps(uint newReplenishmentPriceBps_) public onlyOperator {
        require(newReplenishmentPriceBps_ > 0 && newReplenishmentPriceBps <= 10000, "replenishment price must be over 0");
        replenishmentPriceBps = newReplenishmentPriceBps_;
    }
```
