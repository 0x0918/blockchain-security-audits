# Vulnerability details

## Impact

When creating the contract VariableSupplyERC20Token in [VariableSupplyERC20Token.sol]

(

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl/blob/main/contracts/token/VariableSupplyERC20Token.sol#L40](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl/blob/main/contracts/token/VariableSupplyERC20Token.sol#L40)

), creator is expected to fill in 4 parameters: string memory name_, string memory symbol_, uint256 initialSupply_, uint256 maxSupply_. From the contract, if the creator sets initialSupply_ to be 0, there will be no premints. If the creator sets maxSupply to be 0, that means there is no max supply.

```

@param name_ - Name of the token

@param symbol_ - Symbol of the token

@param initialSupply_ - How much to immediately mint (saves another transaction). If 0, no mint at the beginning.

@param maxSupply_ - What's the maximum supply. The contract won't allow minting over this amount. Set to 0 for no limit.

mintableSupply = maxSupply_;

```

However, the mintableSupply can exit the maxSupply even when the maxSupply is stated during the creation of the contract.

## Proof of Concept

1. Malicious admin can set maxSupply_ to 100,000 and create the contract. Maximum supply is now set to 100,000.

2. Malicious admin can then invoke the mint() function to mint 100,000 tokens into his account. Since mintableSupply is more than 0, the if clause will execute and mintableSupply will become 0.

3. When mintableSupply becomes 0, malicious admin can call the mint() contract again. This time, since mintableSupply is not greater than 0, the _mint() function will execute. Malicious admin can then mint any amount of tokens he wants.

```

function mint(address account, uint256 amount) public onlyAdmin {

require(account != address(0), "INVALID_ADDRESS");

// If we're using maxSupply, we need to make sure we respect it

// mintableSupply = 0 means mint at will

if(mintableSupply > 0) {     -- @audit this check is supposedly meant for the initial "set to 0 for no limit" rule

require(amount <= mintableSupply, "INVALID_AMOUNT");

// We need to reduce the amount only if we're using the limit, if not just leave it be

mintableSupply -= amount; -- @audit when mintableSupply becomes 0, the if block will not execute and the code will proceed to _mint()

}

_mint(account, amount);

}

```

## Tools Used

Manual Auditing

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider setting a soft cap for max supply instead.
